A CS116A Final Project, creating an interactive raytracer with various features, such as creating, destroying, moving, saving, and loading objects, along with editing various lighting conditions and textures.

NOTE: You must have openFrameworks to use this raytracer. Make sure to create a new project, then replace the src files in the new project with the src files in this repository, along with replacing bin/data with the textures in this repository as well.
